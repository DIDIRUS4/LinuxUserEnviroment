This is not Manjaro software, just some tweaks to make your life easier


# Manjaro GNU Linux - Switching via prime
> 1. Open Terminal (Konsole Manjaro or another GNU Linux System with Nvidia-prime)
> 2. Go to path of your program
> 3. For me it's MultiMC Launcher `cd ~/.local/share/multimc && prime-run sh MultiMC`
> 4. Enjoy! You run MultiMC Launcher and other MultiMC trees with Nvidia GPU Priority (Now MultiMC still use Nvidia, not amd/intel graphics)

### Negative factors

- The system does not use your graphics card to its full potential, so sometimes even the integrated graphics will be better.
